paperplaneCMS is a simple no-database knowledge needed Content Management Systems<br>
distributed Source Code Management tool for developing website.<br>
<br>
If you just want to use ppCMS to do your own version of website, you will<br>
need to download Mamp Apache Server -> <a href='http://mamp.info/'>http://mamp.info/</a>
Note: paperplaneCMS for Mac OS X is a project run by volunteers,<br>
so if you want it to improve, volunteer!<br>
<br>
If you want to download and install the complete source code (php)<br>
to start hacking on Git for Windows itself,<br>
Please read install ppCMS to get detailed information.<br>

How to get help<br>
<br>
First, install ppCMS.dmg. No worry, this is easier than you think.<br>
Downloading and executing it will give you a working development cms environment<br>
and automatically are configure during your<br>
installation via real time on your browser, just folow instruction and click next!<br>
<br>
Please note that there are not enough contributors to the ppCMS project to offer<br>
commercial-grade support;<br>
if you do not have the means to fix your problems (possibly with valuable advice<br>
from the ppCMS mailing list),<br>
or to entice people who can fix them, it is unlikely that your problem gets solved.<br>
<br>

How to participate<br>
<br>
Testing and reporting bugs is a big help however you MUST do your research.<br>
Check the issues database and make sure you search closed bugs as well.<br>
When you raise a bug you are expected to be available to provide further<br>
information and to followup with testing.<br>
If you simply raise a bug and then vanish,<br>
your issue will be most likely closed as invalid.<br>
If you really want to ensure something is fixed then provide a patch<br>
or push to the 'mob' branch as below.<br>
<br>
If you made some changes to ppCMS, you can contribute them back by<br>
forking on GoogleCode or SourceForge.<br>
<br>
If instead, you made changes to ppCMS (in /mamp/), you can contribute them back by forking<br>
our ppCMS repository on heroku.com paid cloud hosting. We will invite your account login<br>
to start working.<br>
<br>
Where to discuss issues<br>
<br>
If you want to report a bug in ppCMS itself, ppCMS-svn or ppCMS-gui (non-Windows-specific),<br>
please send a mail to admin@origami-iatkos-server.org.<br>
<br>
If you want to report a bug in ppCMS for Macs (Non Windows-specific),<br>
or in abCMS (Windows-specific), please send a message to our mailing list,<br>
but be aware that posts by non-members, as well as the first post of new members, are moderated.<br>
And please be prepared to put a considerable effort into solving the issue if you want<br>
others to put in the same amount of effort.<br>
<br>
If your question is non Windows-specific, you might want to send it<br>
to the ppCMS mailing list instead (or at least in addition to the ppCMS mailing list).
